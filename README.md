**Everything below is draft and could change, keep those affected in the loop!**

---

## Requirements
* Dimensions footprint: 60x60cm
* Should reflect a Toolsquare machine: locked, idle, running. 
* Gadget max dimension: 14x12cm, height 7cm
* Should be easy to install by one person
* Should be able to run without supervision (so not too easy to break in) 
* Lights!

## The game
1. Unlock the machine using a Toolsquare unit or something else (a coin, a simple nfc reader,..)
2. Use the joystick to positon X and Y
3. Press a button to auto **lower the grabber, raise and dump the gadget**
5. Once a timout is reached the crane goes back to home and needs to be unlocked again
